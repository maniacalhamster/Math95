Communicating math isn't just for teachers/tutors

Important as a learner as well

## Recall School Problem:

Common erroneous soln:
```
Brother         Sister
(1/24)(t-3) =   (1/18)t
3(t-3)      =   4t
-9          =   t
```

Corrections:
```
(1/24)(t+3) =   (1/18)t
(1/24)t     =   (1/18)(t-3)
```

Issue: 

Quantifying, going from fundamentals and applications without fully understanding all aspects of the concepts used.
- Relational/proportional meanings
- equations model situations, which are described by words.   
  > Impo to be **faithfully** modelling problem
- defining variables
  > Impo to appeal to the meeting

Not being able to visualize from just the equation alone.

Getting used to just memorizing, plugging and chugging.

> You want to train students to seek **causality**, not just memorize equations and procedures/algorithms.

Goal: 

Teach/empower students. Don't cripple them. Let them work things out and **discover** on their own. Your role is more guidance than anything.

> Test Driven Development LMAO

## Two Tools for our Students

1. **Emphasize meaning**

    Ex: "Is this right?"
    $$\int cos(2t) dt = sin(2t) + C $$

    > Ans: "How do you check? What does symbol on LHS mean?"

2. **Physical Geometric Algebraic (PGA)**

    Prof Harell's theory on math

    ```
    Perceptual <--> Geometric <--> Algebraic
    ```
    
    P: Perpendicular Bisector

    G:
    ```
            ^
            |
    *---|---|---|---*
    A       |       B
            V
    ```

    A: set of all points equidistant from A and B
